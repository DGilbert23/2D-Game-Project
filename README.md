# 2D-Game-Project
This project was/is a simple sandbox area project for me to learn more about Unity Framework, and game development. This projects is by no means a playable experience, but has helped me understand some of the core concepts to Unity, and see them used in action.

As of the last edit on this README, I've implemented the following:

 - Character movement & collision 
 - Inventory & Equipment management
 - Basic NPC dialogue
 - Object & variable state saving between scenes
